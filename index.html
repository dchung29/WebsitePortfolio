        <h2>Front End Developer</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Da Yun Chung, and welcome to my website portfolio. 
          Art has always been a passion of mine. It gives me the opportunity to express my emotions and ideas tacitly. Rather than writing a thousand words, one picture creatively reveals my philosophy or perspective on a subject I value.</p>
        <p>I have also made it a personal goal to improve my skills in programming over the past year. This website was created using HTML/CSS styling. Making this site was a creative way for me to showcase both my artistic and coding abilities. </p>
        <p>If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me!

            <h1>Project 1</h1>
            <h2>Title: haha u lost >:D</h2> 
            <p>I wanted to explore Charles Darwin’s theories on evolution or natural selection, showing an ape’s contempt for what is considered human ‘intelligence.’ Instead of people measuring its abilities, it mocks mankind’s sense of superiority. The drawing shows a carefree animal that is content and at peace with itself. It never ‘overthinks’ issues or considers complexity valuable. It is simple, happy, and has a sense of humour. I was drawn to this idea after watching a newscast that featured a man playing AlphaGo, against artificial intelligence. It motivated me to follow the examples of Banksy, who also uses animals in his street art. I am happy that the result is a strong representation of my plan. The different tones create contrast and add dimension to develop a sense of “realism” about the animal. Perhaps adding more colour would enhance the image and its focal points. Because everything is in black and white, it may lack popular appeal, nevertheless it reflects my theme transparently.</p>

            <h1>Project 2</h1>
            <h2>Title: A Tribute to Charlie Parker</h2>
            <p>Charlie Parker, also referred to as ‘Bird’, was an American Jazz Saxophonist and composer. He was a highly influential soloist and a leading figure in the bebop movement: a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos and virtuosic technique. The Program cover I designed was for my fathers concert at Mokwon University. My father performed some of Charlie Parker's most famous compositions: Billie's Bounce, Confirmation, and more. I decided that Zen-Doodle was the best artistic form to draw the saxophone. The small intricate details along the instrument represent Parker’s revolutionary ideas and advanced harmonies his music highlights. The different textures and shapes demonstrate the range of the tone his compositions expose: clean, penetrating and somber. In addition, the colour red represents ‘passion’. I felt the need to represent the passion both Charlie Parker and my Father have for jazz music through this cover, and found that the embellishment of colour made the work appeal more.</p>

            <h1>Project 3</h1>
            <h2>Title: Old Downtown Church</h2>
            <p>The Old Downtown Church pen and paper drawing was based off of a photograph I took while on a stroll in downtown Oakville. In this piece, I chose to work with black and white on beige toned illustration paper, giving off a vintage look. 
              I find photography – capturing images – philosophically valuable; a photo has the power to reveal feelings that words cannot. In addition, it provides a useful reference for inspiration when working on design projects. In all my photographs I take today, there are fundamental principles of art: balance, rhythm, movement and more. I ask myself : “What emotions might this work portray? How might it vary in other parts of the world? Different cultures?” “What are some values this work might instill and influence today?”. These questions help me engage in discussions with others about different areas and understandings in and outside of art.</p>

            <h2>Title: Singularity</h2>
            <p>Sharp crisp lines, unnatural bursts of colour and expanses of space. Abstract art has always been a genre I stayed away from. Since a young age, I have been exposed to art styles involving impressionism and realism. I was under the influence that “Abstract art” was not real art. It was only until I visited the Museum of Modern Art during my cross-country road trip across America. I was exposed to the culture and style of non-figurative art. Allowing the viewer to bring their interpretations to the table and question “What does that mean” is the beauty of Abstract art. The piece Singularity showcases the same imaginary image, but through different colour combinations. I decided the title was fitting because there are distinctions between each of the three: tone, vibe and atmosphere. My work was displayed for my highschool art show and it was intriguing to hear every individual's perspective on the work.</p>

            <h1>Project 5</h1>
            <h2>Title: D.O.T.S</h2>
            <p>Many find repetitive work to be draining and constricting. I, however, find value in these tasks. Patience is one of my greatest virtues, and today, I apply it to all of my art projects. The piece D.O.T.S was finished solely by stippling with a 0.1 sized waterproof pen on a 24 x 33 inch piece of paper. I spent approximately 120 hours on this project. I set goals to finish specific areas in set amounts of time. The entire art-piece tested my time management skills, and ability to set “personal due-dates''. Over time, I gradually began to see every aspect of the piece come together. I learned that looking at the bigger picture and setting reasonable goals result in successful pieces. </p>

            <h2>Title: Tofu-Restaurant Parking Lot</h2>
            <p>Tofu-Restaurant Parking Lot is a piece I referenced after a photograph I took while heading to our car after eating out for lunch. I found that the building beside the restaurant had features that would prove to be great drawing practice. The perspective of the stairs, the shadow of a distant large tree splayed across the wall, and the form of every window caught my eye. I took several photos of the building and decided on one to sketch. It was a long process, however I enjoyed every step of it.</p>

            <h2>Title: Model</h2>
            <p>My father gifted me an iPad and apple pencil on my 16th birthday. I immediately took to drawing on it. MODEL was one of my first art pieces using a digital medium: Procreate. I was able to experiment with different brushes, the texture each tool produced and the special effects that could be manipulated. I believed black and white was the best way to maximize the contrast between the highlighted areas and shadows. Though it was difficult to get used to at first, I gradually gained insight on the different features the app had to offer. Today, digital art has become a great hobby of mine. I continue to challenge myself to learn more about the functions the app provides. </p>

            <h1>Project 8</h1>
            <h2>Title: Monroe</h2>
            <p>The piece MONROE was completed by gluing exactly 7904 magazine holepunches onto a piece of illustration board. I wanted to create a large-scale piece using scrap material. To challenge myself and my understanding in coordination, balance, and contrast, I opted to form a face. I initially created a rough sketch on the board, making marks of the lightest and darkest points, then proceeded to start gluing. It was a big risk taking on a highly time-consuming project under a short deadline, however I was determined and every step of the process was fun and fulfilling. Overall, I believe that the final product is a good representation of my original plan. </p>
